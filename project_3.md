# Project 3

## Criteria A: Planning

### Problem definition

The owner of the local game shop is an enthusiast of classic computer games. He has been looking for a talented programmer that can help him revive his passion for text-based games. He has few requirements for this task:

1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.

Apart for this requirements, the owner is open to any type of game, topic or genre.

#### Pre-exsisting product/issue

There are plenty of text-based Blackjack games on the Internet, but ones created on Python were rare. I found it problematic that many of them lacked description and instruction for the game, so that those games' user-friendliness was not satisfactory.

### Proposed Solution

#### Design Statement

I will to design and make a game for a client who is the owner of a local game shop who loves classic computer games. The game will be about text-based cards game and is constructed using the software Pyton on Pychart. It will take 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria shown below. 

#### System

The game is going to be developed on a programming editor named Pycharm on windows10 OS. I chose Pycharm for the software to develop this game because Pycharm is easy to use and pretty intuitive when implementing codings.

#### Justification of the software selected

The programming language I selected for the text-based game development is python on Pycharm. The reason why I selected python for this game development is because it is easy to find hints on the Internet when I got stuck on a part of coding since python is one of the most popular computer language.

#### Game Contents

It is a simple blackjack game. In regular blackjack games, the player is supposed to bet on the game, but for this one, in order to let the player enjoy the pure part of Blackjack. In the game, cards are shown in ascii illustration for the sake of visual usability. For those who are not familiar with Blackjack, as in the success criteria, players can optionally check a brief description of the rules. Also, score, time, and the name of player are stored in a local database in another file as requested.

### Success Criteria

1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.
4. The game actions must be instructed clearly. eg)"Select cards", "Choose an option".
5. The game must show clear description of the rules.
6. The game description and instruction must be in English.
