### Proposed Solution

#### Design Statement

I will to design and make an application for a client who wants a tool to keep the records of the stop and clean his house had. The application records the notes for everyday stop and clean, and provides sign-up/log-in system to the users. It will take 4 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria shown below. 

#### System

The stopandclean managing tool is going to be developed on a programming editor: Pycharm on macOS Monterey version 12.2.1 on MacBook Pro. On Pycharm, the application will use SQLite to store the database on users, SQLalchemy to create an ORM system, and KivyMD to develop the main system.

#### Justification of the software selected

The programming language I selected for the development is python on Pycharm. The reason why I selected python for this game development is because it is easy to find hints on the Internet when I got stuck on a part of coding since python is one of the most popular computer language.

### Success Criteria

1. The application is going to keep the records of stop and clean including the date, tools used, duration, tasks, name of the person in charge of the task, and feedback on the stop and clean by a teacher.
2. The application has a log-in system and sign-up system for the users.
3. The application is going to store the records on its database.
4. The application uses GUI.
5. The application has to be controled with the keyboard and cursor action.
6. The application uses English as the main language.
